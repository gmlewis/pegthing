# pegthing

A game developed for the
[Functional Programming chapter of Clojure for the Brave and True](http://www.braveclojure.com/functional-programming/#4__Peg_Thing_).

To play, just run "lein run".

This version is slightly modified by http://github.com/gmlewis
so that it runs with Clojure 1.10.1 and can generate puzzles
with up to 31 rows.
